# Project03-JuicyBreakout

# Project Name
Neon Matrix Smash

# Description
This is a brick-breaker-style game that has 3 levels.

## Implementation
I added a background to every scene. 

I changed the assets for the ball, paddle, and the blocks.

I added an effect for when a block gets hit and randomness for when a block is loaded in.

I added an effect for when the paddle is hit.

I added background music and sound effects for when the paddle and blocks get hit and when a life is lost. The background music is loaded in the main menu and stays throughout the entire game without restarting when you load a new scene. I also made the music a singleton, so that when you go back to the main menu, you do not have the music playing a second time.

I added a pause menu when escape is pressed.

I made it so that you go to the next level or a win screen when you beat levels one, two, or three.

I made each level have a different number of blocks for an added challenge in each level.

I added a win screen for if you beat level 3.
